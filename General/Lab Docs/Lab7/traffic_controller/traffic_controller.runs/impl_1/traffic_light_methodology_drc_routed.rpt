LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell cnt_10sec[3]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) cnt_10sec_reg[0]/CLR, cnt_10sec_reg[1]/CLR, cnt_10sec_reg[2]/CLR,
cnt_10sec_reg[3]/CLR, tm10_done_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell cnt_15sec[3]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) cnt_15sec_reg[0]/CLR, cnt_15sec_reg[1]/CLR, cnt_15sec_reg[2]/CLR,
cnt_15sec_reg[3]/CLR, tm15_done_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell cnt_3sec[1]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) cnt_3sec_reg[0]/CLR, cnt_3sec_reg[1]/CLR, tm3_done_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
